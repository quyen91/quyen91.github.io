### Read document not stackoverflow all the time
You you use stackoverflow you just solve problem once but if you read document carefully, you understand and use many times then.

### Read code, review, refactor
Before I rarely read others's code, but when I learn ruby I thought diffirently. Because of ruby is easy to read and understand.
Focus on controller and model when you read code
Read code everyday and find something you can learn and improve or refactor your code

### Read book
Don't lay down on the bed and read books day by day. You can't remember all knowledge until you face with problem and apply to it.

### Read blog of good developer

### Fast create side project

### Know about front-end
If you are a back-end developer, you don't need to master everything in front-end development. But you have to have ability of quickly implementing a nice UI of webiste or web application, coding HTML and styling with CSS. Beside Javascript is important thing you need to know, being so good at Javascript will certainly be useful in your software carreer. Today so many Front-end technology (VueJS, ReactJs, AngularJS...) are growing up so fast, that reason why you need to know one of them and can integrate it into your back-end. Besides, in my experience of working, it seems to be compulsory for developer when code any features.

Please be careful with anything you do. Only one small things, or mistake can lead to hundreds of bug and problem.

### Fast solve problem
Time is important, No one can wait for a long time solution. fast think, fast understand, fast show.

### Good and exact at estimation
Life is short, tasks is so many. If we want to be in control of everything, we must estimate time for anything before working exactly.

### Desire to perfect
If you want to solve proble quickly, you need to be so smart (`talent`) or you used to do it before (`experiences`).
